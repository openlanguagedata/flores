## Additional language information

Erzya is one of the largest Finno-Ugric languages, belonging to the Mordvinic branch of the Uralic language family. It has five main dialects: Central, Western (Insar), Northwestern (Alatyr), Southeastern (Sura), and Shoksha. Erzya is spoken by about 300,000 people in the Russian Federation, with several tens of thousands of speakers in other countries, particularly in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan. Despite its official status in the Republic of Mordovia, where Erzya is used in education and media, the language faces challenges in intergenerational transmission and digital presence. However, some digital resources exist:

## Workflow

The FLORES+ dataset was translated from Russian into the Erzya language by two native speakers who are also teachers of the language and writers (one holding a doctoral degree in philology). The 250 translated sentences from Yankovskaya et al. (2023) were also included after a thorough revision. All translations were reviewed by one of the native translators and a linguist with profound expertise in the language.
